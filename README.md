# citi_bike_analysis

I wanted to look into Citi Bike membership in the New Jersey area for the alst two years (2016-2018). I set out to answer the following questions:
1. Has membership been increasing? If so, by how much?
2. Who is riding Citi Bikes? Men or Women? What age groups are typically using the service?
3. How long are people riding the bikes? What gender goes on longer rides and what age groups?
4. What do people use the bikes for? General commuting or work commutes?
5. What time of day do people ride the bikes? 
6. What time of year is most popular for the bikes? Does the number of riders drop in the winter?
7. What stations are people most frequently starting and ending their trips at?
8. Are there certain stations that Customers or Subscribers frequent more often?
9. Are the stations concentrated around a particular area or are they spread out? What part of the city sees the most riders?
10. Do wealthier area see more or less riders? 

The Data set I used had 625527 records and the following columns: 

Trip Duration (seconds)
Start Time and Date
Stop Time and Date
Start Station Name
End Station Name
Station ID
Station Lat/Long
Bike ID
User Type (Customer = 24-hour pass or 3-day pass user; Subscriber = Annual Member)
Gender (Zero=unknown; 1=male; 2=female)
Year of Birth
